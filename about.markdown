Hello, my name is Ã‚n. I am a software developer who is eager to study computer science fundamentals, software engineering principles, and people involved in software development. I also found out that one of the best ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else. That is why this blog was born.

You may disagree with certain topics I am writing about. <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">Email me</a> if you want a discussion. Or you can find me in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenguyenthienan/">Linkedin<a/>.
