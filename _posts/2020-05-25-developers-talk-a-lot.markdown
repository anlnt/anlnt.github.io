When I was a teenager, I chose to become a software developer because I didnâ€™t like to interact with people. I believed that dealing with machines is far easier than with human beings because human relationships are chaotic and unpredictable. I prefered locking myself in a room, sitting in front of a computer and deeply focusing on tough problems. After a few years working in the software industry, my belief turned out to be dead wrong. I found myself spending more hours a day communicating with people than coding. Even harder, people I am talking to come from diverse backgrounds, competencies and motivations.

## Developers versus stakeholders

The job of a developer is to write software. Stakeholder is someone who tells the developer which software they should write. The more experienced you are, the more complex the software you are asked to write. However, the software complexity is not really the issue. The real issue is how to balance between the code quality and the business constraint which is usually the time to market, of the software you are about to write. As a software developer, we are usually expected to deliver more than what we can by a specific date. To survive this situation, we need to collaborate with the stakeholders to deeply understand the business goals we are trying to achieve. After that, we identify features that are high-effort but low-reward, which we can suggest the stakeholders to cut out.

Furthermore, in an Agile software project, we value customer collaboration over contract negotiation. <strong>User</strong> here is a general term which may be product owners, sponsors, or end-users. A software developer is no longer someone who only writes some code that follows a predefined plan which is usually an ill-defined plan. Instead, they need to daily communicate with business people so that they can control backlogs, define stories, split and estimate tasks, help with prioritization, demo implemented features, and collect feedback.

## Developers versus developers

The job of a software developer would be a piece of cake if there is already a database design, someone tells the developer exactly which APIs need to built and how to build them, and which external systems and micro-services need to called. Life is not that simple. As an experienced software developer, you need to by yourself design the software you are about to build. And you almost get feedback from your team when you propose the design. Even though the team all agree with the design, you may receive several comments in relation to the code you write. They may say that your solution is not maintainable, is slow in performance, or violates some security requirements. In other tasks, you may be in the position of the the design or code reviewers. The arguments of the reviewers may be valid or not. The point is to figure it out you need a respectful conversation where each party wants to truly understand what each other means.

Another circumstance where you need to communicate with other software developers is that they ask for your advice in relation to business modules or technical problems they believe that you have more experiences with than they do, and vice versa. Software developers are responsible to help each other. So the idea of building a wall surrounding us and our computer is not viable if we still work in the software industry, I believe.
