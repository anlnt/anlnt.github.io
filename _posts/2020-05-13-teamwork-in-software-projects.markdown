Software engineers work as a team. When one engineer cannot afford the delivery speed that business requires, we need more people working together in the same project.

## Mission

People working together creates a group. A group is not really a team if they don’t have missions. In software engineering, a mission usually comes from a customer pain point. What makes users annoyed. What costs users time, effort, and money. How much value we bring to users if we solve their pain points. It’s why we write code for. Requirements are just secondary. In effective teams, we just need to tell them the mission. They then do their own ways to complete the mission. They may find requirements that product owners haven’t thought about. They work hard to overcome obstacles on their way or even work extra hours to accomplish the mission.

## Leadership

A leader is someone who is in charge of the accomplishment of the mission. Every single mission requires a leader. I am not expert enough to explain why. I learned the hard way the idea of a self-directed team or a team where everyone is in charge is not realistic. A leader may not have a fancy title. It almost does not matter who it is. The team just needs someone who calls the shots. A leader doesn’t tell anyone that he is their leader. You may find yourself a leader when:
- Someone asks you if they are doing the right thing.
- Your project is at risk missing a hard deadline due to an unexpected issue in the last minute. You make a call to save the project and everyone follows you without hesitation.
- You always follow through your commitments. People rely on you. If you said you were going to it, they know that you are going to do it.
- You overcome any obstacles that prevent your team from accomplishing the mission by yourself or you ask for help if you are not able to solve the issues.

## Ownership

Ownership is an obsession with the accomplishment of a mission. If the mission fails, the team will feel bad or guilty. They may blame themselves for not trying hard enough or making bad decisions. Because of that mindset, they do whatever it takes to complete the mission. No one can stop them from achieving their goals.

## Individual vs. team

In software engineering teams I have joined, every single engineer is expected to express their own thoughts. For example, we are encouraged to raise our concerns in relation to solutions the product owner suggests to solve customer pain points. Or we voice our objections when we think that a particular technical implementation is hard to maintain, hurts performance, breaks security policies, or does not fit into team resources or delivery schedule at the time being. What if the team wants to do something that I don’t want to do even though I have raised my objections?

When I am working in a team, my own needs come secondary to the needs of the team. Sometimes, although I don’t agree with what the team wants to do, I still give them full support. You may think that I don’t have a strong opinion. In a software development team, I think that doing the right thing is less important than doing the thing that the team all commit to. That is the key to build a gelled team that plans together, solves problems together, faces issues together, and gets things done. Besides, software engineers are hard to know what is right until what they build is released to users who will give the engineers feedback. The cost to enhance or even rebuild a new software functionality is cheap so we don’t need to spend too much energy and time on long debates.
