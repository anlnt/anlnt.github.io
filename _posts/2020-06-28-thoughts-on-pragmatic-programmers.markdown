Pragmatic programmers, professional developers, or software craftsmans are referring to people who are fluent at their job as a software developer. I have read several books and articles in relation to what makes a pragmatic programmer. I have my own thoughts too. I am going to summarize them in this post.

## Fast adaptability
Regardless of how tough the situation they are put into, they eventually figure out a way out. They are so confident. Whatever the problem is, they know that they can learn what they need to learn to get things done. They are not afraid of doing the jobs they do not feel comfortable with. I realize that they constantly push themselves outside of their comfort zone. Doing so helps them develop and maintain their adaptability. 

## Understanding fundamentals
They do not accept magic easily. They are passionate to understand how things work under the hood. To them, complex systems comprise of many basic blocks which are built using knowledge regarding operating systems, networking, programming languages, databases, and cryptography. Thanks to this knowledge, they can grasp anything new quickly and survive any tough situations they have not been put into before.

## Critical thinking
They don’t employ a technology just because giant companies are using it. They don’t jump to conclusions without getting the facts. When someone says “That's the way it has to be done”, they smell a challenge.

## Generalist
They try hard to be familiar with many technologies, programming languages, frameworks, and development methodologies. They can take any roles in the software development cycle. I am not saying they master all these things. At least, they know who they should look for when they need help.

## Specialist
They are a go-to person for several areas in their company. They may be an expert in frontend development, database systems, system performance, or testing. They spend a vast amount of time learning and practicing these skills only because of passion.

## Self-learning
They keep learning by themselves to be relevant to the tech industry. They know how to balance between learning a lot a bit and learning a bit a lot. In other words, they may learn right enough to get the job done but under certain circumstances they learn deeply in order to solve a complicated problem.

## Business focus
At the end of the day, someone pays us to write software, helping their business move forward. A pragmatic programmer does not bury himself in a tomb of cool technologies, without any ideas how business operates out there. Instead, every technical decision they make, they take business constraints into account.

## Communication
They are willing to talk to anyone including colleagues inside and outside their team. They are open to ideas from anyone. They don’t blindly defend themselves. They can ask the right questions. Finally, they are sensitive to any miscommunications that negatively affect their teamwork. 

## Mentoring
Everyone starts their career as a junior developer who needs mentoring. There are two mentors that affect my career the most. One taught me how to write code in industry projects. The other taught me communication and thinking processes. In my opinion, experienced developers have a responsibility to level up junior developers.
