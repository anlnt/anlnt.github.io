Software developers spend much time a day thinking. For example, we think about whether to implement a feature this or that way, how we name a method or a class, or which class or method we should put a logic in. Believe me, we are so easy to make bad decisions. To mitigate this, teams usually review code of each member before he deploys his changes. During the code review session, the author is expected to address feedback from his coworkers. There is sometimes a conflict between reviewers and the reviewee. It becomes worse if we let [motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning) in these situations.

Back in 2016, I was in a code review session of implementing a new feature. I had done testing before to make sure my change met requirements and the change got several approvals from my teammates. However, there is a man telling me that I was wrong. I was able to prove his concern invalid but he didn't listen to me. I was so frustrated at the time being, asking myself why he was so convinced that I was wrong although I wasn't. Moving to other companies, I keep seeing these cases. Some people try to defend themselves whenever there is an idea that they do not agree with. I know why now. It's because of the mindset they are in when they interpret a new idea.

In a talk, [Why you think you're right, even when you're wrong](https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong), Julia Galef said that we are usually in a soldier mindset or scout mindset when we process information in our daily lives. Soldiers are those whose actions are driven by a need to protect themselves and their side, and to defeat the enemy. On the other hand, the scout's job is not to attack or defend. They are sent out to identify roadblocks or get all information of what people outside are doing. They want to know what really happens out there as precisely as possible. I quote what Julia Galef said regarding people with soldier mindset:

> Some pieces of information feel like our allies - we want them to win; we want to defend them. And other pieces of information are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. That's why I call motivated reasoning "soldier mindset."

By contrast, those adapting to scout mindset feel interesting when they meet something that contradicts what they have believed in. Even if they find out that they have been wrong, they don't feel bad or guilty at all. To them it does not matter which side is right or wrong. What they do want is to find the truth.

Finally, how do we apply these lessons for software development? The following is what we can do:
- In a code review or team discussion, if someone has an idea that is different from ours, listen to them. By "listen", I mean we truly understand what they want to say. While listening, assume that they may be right and their ideas may be better than ours. This is the key to openness. We never accept a new idea if we don't consider it valid.
- Easy to accept mistakes. Don't feel guilty or stupid when we have made a bad decision.
