Software developers spend a lot of time a day thinking. For example, we think about whether to implement a feature a particular way, how we name a method or a class, or where between we should inject logic into. Believe me, it is so easy for us to make bad decisions. To single out and resolve these, a code review process is employed before any deplyoyments could be made. During the code review session, the author is expected to address feedback from their coworkers. There is sometimes a conflict between reviewers and the reviewee. It becomes worse if we let [motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning) in these situations.

Back in 2016, I was under a code review session of implementing a new feature. I had done testing before to make sure my change met requirements and the change got several approvals from my teammates. However, there was this one man who incessantly insisted that I was wrong despite the fact that I was able to prove his concerns invalid. This incident and multiple instances I encountered afterwards at different companies instills in me a big why question. I didn't have a concrete explanation until recently. Some people try to defend themselves whenever there is an idea that they do not agree with. It's because of the mindset they are in when they interpret a new idea.

In a talk, [Why you think you're right, even when you're wrong](https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong), Julia Galef said that we are usually in a soldier mindset or scout mindset when we process information in our daily lives. Soldiers are those whose actions are driven by a need to protect themselves and their side, and to defeat the enemy. On the other hand, the scout's job is not to attack or defend. They are sent out to identify roadblocks or get all information of what people outside are doing. They want to know what really happens out there as precisely as possible. I quote what Julia Galef said regarding people with soldier mindset:

> Some pieces of information feel like our allies - we want them to win; we want to defend them. And other pieces of information are the enemy, and we want to shoot them down. That's why I call motivated reasoning "soldier mindset."

Those adapting to scout mindset feel interesting when they meet something that contradicts what they have believed in. Even if they find out that they have been wrong, they don't feel bad or guilty at all. To them it does not matter which side is right or wrong. What they do want is to find the truth.

Finally, how do we apply these lessons to software development? The following is what we can do:
- In a code review or team discussion, if someone has an idea that is different from ours, listen to them. By "listen", I mean we truly understand what they mean. While listening, assume that they may be right and their ideas may be better than ours. This is the key to openness. We never accept a new idea if we don't consider it valid.
- Accept mistakes. Don't feel guilty or stupid when we have made a bad decision.
- Do not consider ourselves weak if we change our mind.
