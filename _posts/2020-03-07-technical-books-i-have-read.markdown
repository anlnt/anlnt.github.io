As a software engineer, we have to keep learning to survive the day-by-day change of technologies. Different people have different ways to make themselves up to date. Some people enjoy technical conferences. Others subscribe blogs or social sharing of the top leaders in our industry. I prefer reading books. The following are types of books I have read.
<br />

**Technology-specific** books are vital for instant need when we want to learn a new programming language or framework. For example, I read [Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Rails-Tutorial-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321743121) when I switched from a C++ Windows application developer to a RoR full-stack developer. It was useful at the time being but it soon expired. As I wrote this post, the latest version of Rails is 6.0. Another reason we look for this kind of book is that we want to deeply understand a specific aspect of a technology. Back in 2016, I was working on a Rails project that had database performance issues with MySQL. I searched for which books could help and I got [High Performance MySQL: Optimization, Backups, and Replication](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-MySQL-Optimization-Replication/dp/1449314287).
<br />

**Conceptual** books are ones that teach us fundamentals. I learned the hard way that no matter how hard we try, there is always something we don't know because we don't have enough time and energy to learn everything. So how are we, software engineers, not left behind due to the fact that new technologies emerge everyday? The answer is that we build the ability to learn fast. We need to acquire the backgrounds that are almost the same in software engineering systems. They are knowledge regarding programming languages, operating systems, computer networks, database systems, cryptography, and software engineering practices like unit tests, refactoring, planning and estimation, and design patterns. Some books in this category as followed:

- [Operating System Concepts](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz-ebook/dp/B07CVKH7BD)
- [Database Systems: Design, Implementation, and Management](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Systems-Implementation-Management-Essential/dp/1111969604)
- [Computer Security: Principles and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Security-Principles-Practice-4th/dp/0134794109)
- [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Code-EFFECT-ebook/dp/B005OYHF0A)
- [Agile Estimating and Planning](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp/0131479415) <br />

Usually, we cannot apply knowledge in the above books immediately. It requires time and production experiences to digest the information. For example, when I learned multithreading in my university, I had no idea what it was for. But I do now. Understanding multithreading helped me solve several performance issues in my projects as well as quickly get familiar with big data processing systems.
<br />

Finally, **behavioral** books, which I like the most, are books that help us work efficiently with other software engineers, business people, deadlines and things other than technical stuff like programming or frameworks. These books are talking more about human e.g. how we deal with customers when we miss a schedule or say no when we are imposed an unrealistic deadline. [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) and [The Software Craftsman](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501) are my two favorite books in this category.
