We are living in an era where patience may be unlikely valuable. Everything we want, we want it immediately. We want other people to deliver what we desire as soon as possible. We don't have patience to wait for others. We build a faster-is-better culture. As a result, we may think that patient people are old, scared, overthinking, unenergetic, or not engaged. However, to be an effective software engineer, we need patience.

If you are an experienced software engineer who has over two years working in a production project, you are no longer just doing what are told by your team lead. Instead, you are expected to solve problems from business people by yourself, keeping their business moving forward. Most of the time, we need a dedicated time to gain an understanding of a problem before discussing a solution. The more complex a problem is, the more time we need. For example, if a user reports a bug, we need to replicate the bug to see what has really happened to the user. Then, if we are not patient enough, we may tell the stakeholder "Hey, what exactly do you want me to do to fix this issue?". On the other hand, a patient software engineer would trace the reason back and if the decision was made by someone in another team, they may need a conversation with the author. After understanding the problem, they propose appropriate solutions to the stakeholder. Their solutions are based on trade-offs regarding schedules, team resources, and impacts to the current system.

More examples of patient software engineers:
- They are able to reveal unspoken requirements from stakeholders, tirelessly asking questions to clarify requirements. They explore the current system as a user and thoroughly examine the codebase to figure out what needs to be built. They practice [second-order thinking](https://medium.com/@noahmp/second-order-thinking-3fc2a224b131) to expose the implications due to the new requirements.
- They are a bug hunter in their projects. They fastidiously wander around a system to look for a bug. When they find one, they thoroughly evaluate how severe it is. They may find bugs that have been existing for a long time but no one notices.

Finally, how do we learn patience? Above all, patience means that we keep calm and quiet to contemplate a problem. The prerequisite of learning patience is to accept that everything can wait. As a manager or a leader, to help your members learn patience, do not put them in a time limit. People tend to skip important details when they are in high pressure.
