When I started my career as a software engineer, I was scared whenever someone asked me how long something would take. I thought that if I overestimated a task, my manager may have accused me of giving a padded estimate. Or if I underestimated the task, I would have to work overtime or at the weekend, sacrificing time for my family and social activities in order to deliver the work on time. All these panics were because I didn’t understand the nature of software estimation.

Businesses have important reasons to ask for an estimate. For example, they need the delivery timeline of new features so that they plan for marketing campaigns or user training sessions. Although estimation is hard because we are definitely unable to see the feature, as a professional software engineer, we need to learn how to give an estimate.

## Estimate vs. commitment

Most people are confused about an estimate and a commitment. Estimate is a **prediction** of how long something will take or how much it will cost. Someone may say “I estimate that this task may take 5 days”. That means it will likely get done in 5 days but might also take 6 days, or even 9 days to complete. It may finish early, probably 3 days but it is rare because human beings are naturally optimistic, underestimating what we are about to do. The important thing is no promise is made and missing an estimate does not cause a software engineer to be less professional.

A commitment is something we must achieve. For instance, a new security policy has just been enacted by the government, taking effect by the end of this month, which your product has not been in compliance with at the time being. The business asks you to commit that you will deliver a change so that your product follows the new policy. If you estimate that this is achievable and you commit to get it done by the end of this month, you have to get it done by that day. If you miss a commitment, your company will be  damaged and so are your reputation and paycheck. If you are not comfortable delivering the change by the deadline, you are horor to decline to make a commitment.

One problem is that software engineers think that they have to meet the estimate, putting themselves in high pressure. Another problem is that someone takes the estimates from engineering teams to make commitments to other people, bringing high pressure to the engineering teams. Consequently, the software engineers work long hours to finish their job, burning themselves out and leaving a lot of technical debt and bugs.

## Estimate vs. guesstimate

I have observed some developers to react when being asked how long something would take. Usually, they keep silent for a while and say “I am not sure. It may take two or three days”. In some cases, I know that they haven’t implemented a similar task before or they haven’t even known the feature that they are about to make changes to. I wonder how they have come up with that estimate. The answer is that they guess.

Guessing is one of the methodologies to give an estimate. When guessing, we know an acceptable range of an estimate and we pick the most socially acceptable one. For example, if we know the estimate is from one to ten days, we may pick four, five, or six days as our estimate. If we know that our team leads, managers, teammates, or stakeholders expect five days, we tend to choose five days to avoid upsetting everyone and any confrontation. My advice is not to guess. There is no correlation between guessing and the complexity and difficulty of the task we are going to do, especially in legacy systems or modules we have never touched. Our assumptions will likely turn out to be wrong. Instead, spend a dedicated time learning the current modules we are about to change, splitting up work to smaller tasks and giving each an estimate. I am going to write in detail about some basic techniques I have used to estimate a task in the next post.
